     <P>The table below is taken from the "examples" folder of django-tables2 repository.
        This is not typical usage, but the simplest thing to demonstrate.  The table is a
         django-tables2.Table, not one of the specialized types of Tables.  There is no template
        associated with a class. The only template that comes into play is named in the render() call,
         and it is a regular old  html file in the django app's templates.  What we do get is
         decent looking layout and a professional-looking color scheme.

     <P>The setup required:
        <DL>
        <DT>install `django_bootstrap4` with pip or similar</DT>
            <DD>Note: <b>not</b>
                the pypi package `bootstrap4`. After you do that,
        look in your site-packages.  It will have installed about 12 libraries, a lot of
        beautiful soup.  But the immediate one we care about is `bootstrap4`.  It has a folder
            (which is a python package) called templatetags</DD>
        <DT>Add `bootstrap4` to settings.py Installed Apps.</DT>
        <DL>Even though it is installed from package django_bootstrap4, the package is named
        bootstrap4.  When your template says {% verbatim %}{% load bootstrap4 %}{% endverbatim %}, django will look in
        that package (which will be in site-packages).</DL>
        <DT>Sorting doesn't work without code</DT>
        <DD>The {% verbatim %}{% render_table table %}{% endverbatim %} generates links back
        to  its own url, appending a "sort=" argument.  But the django view would have to find
        and use that for it to have an effect.  All it does here is cause the page to reload</DD>
    </DL>
